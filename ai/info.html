        <h3>What is "NSF AI Across the Curriculum"?</h3>
        <p class="indented">
          NSF AI Across the Curriculum is a joint program at FAMU and UF,
          funded by the US National Science Foundation (NSF). The goal of
          this program is to enhance the diversity of undergraduate students
          pursuing AI-related coursework. AI is poised to redefine nearly all
          aspects of human society. We want to help create a future
          workforce in which diverse viewpoints are included and AI systems
          are developed and deployed equitably and fairly. We think the best
          way to do this is to ensure that diverse students enter the workforce
          equipped to engage AI in their chosen field. To support these goals,
          our program provides direct financial assistance to undergraduate
          students pursuing AI-related coursework and undergraduate
          research and scholarship.
        </p>

        <h3>What is AI?</h3>
        <p class="indented">
          AI or "Artifiical Intelligence" can be defined as any
          approach that attempts to 'mimic' human or other 'natural
          intelligence' using computers. Our program defines "AI" very
          broadly and includes not only traditional computer-science
          work but also critique of AI, examinations of AI's impact on
          society, law and the natural world, AI ethics, applications of
          AI in the sciences, humanities and business, and artistic works
          that incorporate AI.

        <h3>Who is eligible for undergraduate awards?</h3>
        <p class="indented">
          Any undergraduate student attending FAMU or UF and majoring in
          <strong>any</strong> discipline is eligible for awards through
          our program. If you want to learn to engate AI in
          <strong>your</strong> field, we want to support you!
        </p>

        <h3>How do I apply for an undergraduate award?</h3>
        <p class="indented">
          Details about the available undergraduate awards can be found on our
          <a href="./" target="_blank">main awards page</a>.
          Award applications can be submitted by filling out a short online
          form.
        </p>

        <h3>What is the deadline for undergraduate award applications?</h3>
        <p class="indented">
          There is no deadline for any of our undergraduate awards; you can
          apply at any time. Awards will be made on a rolling basis, and it
          typically takes us about 1 month to approve and process a successful
          award application. We will continue to process and approve awards
          unitil we run out of money. We typically receive funding from NSF
          in the early fall of each year, so it's probably best to apply for
          awards during late summer, before the start of the fall semester.
        </p>

        <h3>If I receive an award, how do I get my money?</h3>
        <p class="indented">
          Undergraduate awards will be deposited directly into your student
          account at your university, subject to university policies and
          regulations. In most cases, awards will be applied toward any
          outstanding tuition and fees at your university. Any remainder
          is typically returned to you as a check, although this is subject
          to your university's policies.
        </p>

        <h3>Are there reporting requirements for undergraduate awards?</h3>
        <p class="indented">
          Nope. After you receive an award, you don't need to report your
          activities to us, unless you want to. Work with your academic
          or faculty advisor at your university to fulfill the requirements
          of your award.
        </p>

        <h3>What happens if I can't complete the requirements of my award?</h3>
        <p class="indented">
          We understand that various hardships can come up. Our awards are
          flexible and don't have strict timelines. If you are having
          difficulty fulfilling the requirements of your award, you should
          first work with your academic or faculty advisor at your university
          to try to get back on track. If you have any serious concerns, please
          contact us through the contact form at the bottom of this page, and
          we will work with you to help address your concerns. And don't panic,
          we aren't going to track you down and try to get your award money
          back! We're here to help you succeed, not cause more difficulty.
        </p>
