        <p>
          The US National Science Foundation is funding a joint program to
          train undergraduate students attending FAMU and UF in AI
          applications across <strong>all</strong> university majors.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          This program is available to <strong>all</strong> FAMU and UF
          undergraduates, and does not require a strong technical background.
          If you want to learn to engage AI in <strong>your</strong> field,
          we have a program to help support you!
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Our program offers 3 different awards for undergraduate students
          attending FAMU or UF and majoring in <strong>any</strong>
          discipline.
        </p>

        <h3>AI Diversity Fellowship</h3>
        <p class="indented">
          AI Diversity Fellowships are $5000 and require that you attempt to
          complete at least 9 credit-hours in AI-related undergraduate
          coursework.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The aim of these fellowships is to enhance the diversity of students
          pursuing AI-related coursework. Students from historically
          under-represented groups are particularly encouraged to apply.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          As with all our programs, a technical background or experience in
          AI or computer programming is <strong>not</strong> required. We
          are looking to support students from <strong>all</strong> majors
          and backgrounds!
        </p>

        <h3>AI Research Fellowship</h3>
        <p>
          AI Research Fellowships are $5000 and require that you conduct
          an undergraduate research project under the guidance of a
          faculty member at your university.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Teams of up to 5 students may submit a single application, and
          <strong>each</strong> student will receive an individual award.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          You should identify a faculty mentor at your university and discuss
          the research project before submitting an AI Research Fellowship
          application.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          We define "research" broadly and are <strong>not</strong> only
          interested in supporting scientific research. <strong>Any</strong>
          project from <strong>any</strong> discipline will be considered.
          We particularly encourage students intersted in using AI in
          the arts and humanities to apply!

        <h3>University AI Scholars</h3>
        <p>
          University AI Scholars awards include $1750 student stipend and
          a $500 faculty award to help cover project costs.
          This program allows students to work
          one-on-one with a faculty mentor at their university to
          conduct a year-long project exploring AI in their chosen
          discipline.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Students should identify a faculty mentor at their university and
          discuss the project before submitting an application.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>

        <h3>AI Course Development Awards</h3>
        <p>
          In addition to our undergraduate student programs, we
          also provide course development awards to instructors
          at FAMU or UF.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          AI Course Development Awards can be used to develop new
          undergraduate courses in AI or to significantly modify
          an existing course to incorporate AI.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Courses can be in any discipline but must include AI-related
          concepts, methods, tools or techniques in a significant
          and meaningful way.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Course development awards are $5000, which must be used
          to support course-development related activities.
        </p>
